# EstimatingVAriationalWindFields-SpectralAnalysis
Exploring several ways of estimating an adjusted wind field by solving an eliptic equation through fouries series and a detailed analysis for the effects of boundarie conditions over mesoscale regions by calculating the mass-loss percentage on 3 different Boundary Value Problems (BVPs).
