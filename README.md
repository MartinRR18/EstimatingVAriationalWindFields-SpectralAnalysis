# EstimatingVAriationalWindFields-SpectralAnalysis
-Exploring several ways of estimating an adjusted wind field by solving an eliptic equation through fouries series and a detailed analysis for the effects of boundarie conditions over mesoscale regions by calculating the mass-loss percentage on 3 different Boundary Value Problems (BVPs). 

## Libraries
-Simbolic estimation of fourier coefficients is possible with sympy libraries

-Better and precise graphs of fourier series are analyse using mathplotlib

-numpy for numeric calculus and arrays gen
